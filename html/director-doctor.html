                            <p>Netflix is one of the most famous solutions. Initially, it was a DVD rental service
                                that
                                saw
                                the world and was the first to offer a catalogue of films and TV shows on a monthly
                                subscription. The company has gained momentum and has more than 40 million
                                subscribers
                                around the world, and it is regularly launched in new countries. Its strength is a
                                large
                                catalogue, a comedy collection and others besides. Unfortunately, they regularly
                                increase
                                subscription costs and no longer offer trial periods. Users can count on new

                                "Brightburn" is a story about Supermen in the horror genre. Tori and her husband are
                                happy,
                                but they want a child. When an alien child falls from the sky, the wishes of the
                                family
                                are
                                fulfilled. But when little Brandon develops abilities, the boy becomes not a
                                superhero,
                                but
                                a great danger.

                                her time at home because of her anxiety. One evening she sees an alleged attack on
                                her
                                neighbour from the window of her house. Is the accident real, or is it just her
                                imagination?

                                " Blinded by the Light " is a coming of age story about a boy with Pakistani roots
                                who
                                grew
                                up in England and, inspired by Bruce Springsteen, decided to become a writer. But,
                                his
                                strict family would like their offspring to have a different future.

                                For a picture to be in the ‘top 10 most successful’ movies, it must meet certain
                                criteria.
                                On the one hand, Netflix itself should have made the movies. On the other hand, only
                                viewers
                                who broadcast the title within the first four weeks of its appearance are counted on
                                the
                                list. At this time, Netflix advertises them on its homepage and they quickly attract
                                user
                                attention and arouse interest. Bloomberg reports that viewers had to watch the film
                                for
                                only
                                two minutes for it to be counted. There is a certain risk involved here that the
                                list
                                becomes less significant. It is quite possible that the film was so boring to
                                customers
                                in 5
                                minutes that they turned it off. A collection of fighters from other platforms will
                                be
                                selected for comparison.

                                Marvel movies collection

                                Initially, it was a company producing American "comics," unlike the Franco-Belgian
                                comics
                                school or Japanese Mangas. Founded in 1939 by Martin Goodman, publisher of pulps
                                magazine,
                                it was then called Timely Publications. Although she began with the release of
                                series
                                about
                                superheroes in the early 1940s, she completely abandoned them over the next decade.
                                In
                                the
                                early 60s, she took the final name of Marvel and reinvested in a field of
                                superheroes
                                that
                                she would never leave again. Then the company will experience ups and downs, it is
                                regularly
                                bought or dismembered, even bankruptcy in proper and proper form in 1996. After they
                                initially sold the rights to their comics to movies studios only in the 1990s, at
                                the
                                turn
                                of the millennium, the publisher decided to take over the production of their
                                cinema.
                                Although Marvel Studios originally portrayed individual superhero stories in the
                                respective
                                films, in the end they should unite and fight together against evil.

                                Finally, to everyone's surprise, in August 2009, Marvel took over the Walt Disney
                                Company.
                                Thus, Mickey strengthens his already strong position in the field of family
                                entertainment
                                with high added value, allowing you to open various cinemas, goods and theme parks.

                                follows in the footsteps of his rival Warner. The cinematic universe is also
                                available
                                in
                                short films. For a while, with each Blu-ray release, the House of Ideas offered a
                                unique
                                Marvel One-Shot. Some of these stories are rather anecdotal. But others are
                                important
                                for
                                common understanding.

                                Earth is the scene of a collision between two alien races, Kree and Skrulls. Before
                                returning to space, the one who became Captain Marvel gives Nick Fury (Samuel L.
                                Jackson) a

                                efforts,
                                the
                                titan manages to capture the five Infinity Stones, and then he has immeasurable
                                power.
                                By
                                clicking his finger, he makes half of the living beings in the universe disappear,
                                including
                                most of the heroes. At the end of the credits, before surrendering, Nick Fury calls
                                Captain
                                Marvel. Duration: 2:40.

                                characters of the (amazing) Natasha Romanoff family will appear in the film. There
